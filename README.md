Sometimes you wish you could zoom in on a YouTube video, or only view a part of the video screen.

panZoomYouTube is a Chrome extension that allows you to pan and zoom YouTube Videos when in fullscreen mode. Simply use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Y to toggle pan and zoom mode. Or click the text link 'Enter PanZoom Mode' directly underneath the YouTube video.
